Web tool for lighting technicians based on a spreadsheet by Matt Ardine


This project is intended to make an easy-to-use web tool based on Matt Ardine's spreadsheet downloadable from http://www.mattardine.com/?page_id=741 and located in ./docs.  My hope is that lighting technicians will be able to use Matt's data, presented through this tool, to rapidly determine the safety of lighting equipment they wish to place on an aerial lift.
