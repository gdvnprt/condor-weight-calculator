Web tool for lighting technicians based on a spreadsheet by Matt Ardine


This project is intended to make an easy-to-use web tool based on Matt Ardine's spreadsheet downloadable from http://www.mattardine.com/?page_id=741 and located in ./docs.  My hope is that lighting technicians will be able to use Matt's data, presented through this tool, to rapidly determine the safety of lighting equipment they wish to place on an aerial lift.

Project is now in beta and I would like feedback making sure all the numbers and math are correct.  Until I've had outside eyes check the calculations, be careful using.

Notes:

I want to make this mobile-friendly eventually, but don't have the styling skill yet.

Comments should help future contributors/updaters to easily add new lighting equipment, lifts, etc.

I've aimed to make this as friendly to updates and expansion as possible.  The core should theoretically be present for more advanced calculations - would just need to add in ways to adjust the modifier for basket items based on distance.
